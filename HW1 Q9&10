Q9

We would use triangular distribution since there is no data about the delay from cardiac arrest to the time an ambulance is dispatched. 
Information that we know about this triangular distribution is the most likely time is 2.5 mins, minimal is 1.5 mins, and maximum is 3.5 mins.

Q10

We know that volunteers who receive alerts will be within 1 kilometer of the OHCA. With no dataset about volunteers location,
we can set up random variable with uniform distribution from 0 to 1 represent the distance from OHCA to volunteer. Once we get the distance, 
with the OHCA Lat & Long, it forms a cycle with radius distance. Generate a uniform number (-1,1), add that number to Lat. 
Then use the formular of distance between points to find the Long(the result will be equal to the distance from OHCA to volunteer).
